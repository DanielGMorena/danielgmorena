# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Madrid, focused on backend systems, Python, and DevOps.  
For the past few years, I’ve been building scalable platforms, automating deployments, and mentoring developers who care about doing things right.

I work mostly with **Python (FastAPI, Django, AsyncIO)**, **containerized microservices**, and **CI/CD pipelines** that actually make shipping enjoyable.  
Lately, I’ve been exploring **vector databases** and **LLM-based search systems** — practical AI for real engineering teams.

### 🚀 A bit of what I’ve been doing
- Leading backend and DevOps at **Fhecor Ingenieros**, building cloud-native tools for engineering workflows.  
- Designing internal systems that cut reporting times by over 60%.  
- Deploying Kubernetes-based infrastructure and observability with **Prometheus + Grafana**.  
- Previously co-founded a real-time geospatial mobile game — building the backend and learning a ton about distributed systems and scale.

### 🌍 About me
Civil engineer turned software engineer. I like systems that are robust, maintainable, and simple enough to survive production.  
Outside of work, I’m usually learning, traveling, or sketching ideas for side projects that may or may not see the light of day.
