# Hi, I'm Daniel üëã

I'm a **Senior Backend Engineer** based in **Madrid**, focused on **Python** and **high-performance backend systems** with a strong **DevOps** mindset.  
For the past few years, I‚Äôve been **building scalable platforms**, **automating deployments**, and **mentoring developers** who care about doing things right.

I work mostly with **Python (FastAPI, Django, AsyncIO)**, **containerized microservices**, and **CI/CD pipelines** that make shipping reliable.  
Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring **vector databases** and **LLM-based search systems** ‚Äî practical AI for real engineering teams.

---

### üöÄ A bit of what I‚Äôve been doing
- Leading **backend** and **DevOps** at **Fhecor Ingenieros**, building **cloud-native** tools for engineering workflows.  
- Designing internal systems that cut reporting times by **over 60%**.  
- Deploying **Kubernetes** infrastructure and observability with **Prometheus + Grafana**.  
- Previously co-founded a **real-time geospatial mobile game** ‚Äî building the **distributed backend** and learning a ton about **scale**.

### üåç About me
Civil engineer turned software engineer. I like systems that are **robust**, **maintainable**, and **simple** enough to survive production.  
Outside of work, I‚Äôm usually learning, traveling, or sketching ideas for side projects that may or may not see the light of day.
